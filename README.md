# ypacheco-site
For the final project I changed the design by using other colors the background, and I also added sections through the website. I made it more dynamic and easy to navigate. I really liked how it looks and I can say that you can see my personality and style on my site, so I am happy with the result.

The technologies that I used were provided by the CSET3100 course. The website used technologies such as Google analytics, responsive design, advanced javascript functions, optimization and other techniques provided by the course.
